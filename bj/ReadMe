BlackJack.py is a simple python console game.
It requires python 2 - probably 2.4 or higher but was written and tested in python 2.7

Linux and *nix users with python located at /usr/bin/python need simply enter command
./BlackJack.py

or 
python BlackJack.py

or  from a python console
import BlackJack
will start the program.

otherwise try
<path to python>/python BlackJack.py 

This was a UDEMY Milestone project
